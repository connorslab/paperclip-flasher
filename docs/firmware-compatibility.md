# Firmware compatibility

The 0.1.0 prerelease supports original Goldshell KDBox firmware **2.2.1** only.
The 0.1.1 prerelease supports **2.0.6**, plus **2.0.5, 2.0.7q, 2.0.8, 2.0.9, 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.1.3, 2.2.0 and 2.2.3** after installation, accepted-share,
pool-display and reboot tests on an original KDBox / MCB_V5_4.

Other Goldshell models and control boards are not covered by these results.
A bundled mining engine or a known SSH password does not establish compatibility.

## Firmware inventory

All images below came from the [official Goldshell firmware repository](https://github.com/goldshellminer/firmware/tree/master/KDA-Miner/Goldshell-KDBox).
Their firmware payload signatures were verified against the vendor compatibility public key.

| Firmware | Installation and mining | SSH access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2.0.5 | Passed, including reboot | Legacy password matches firmware hash |
| 2.0.6 | Passed; reboot at 500 MHz and 740 MHz thermal run | Legacy password matches firmware hash |
| 2.0.7q | Passed, including reboot | Legacy password matches firmware hash |
| 2.0.8 | Passed, including reboot | Legacy password matches firmware hash |
| 2.0.9 | Passed, including reboot | 2.2.1 password matches firmware hash |
| 2.1.0 | Passed, including reboot | 2.2.1 password matches firmware hash |
| 2.1.1 | Passed, including reboot | 2.2.1 password matches firmware hash |
| 2.1.3 | Passed, including reboot | 2.2.1 password matches firmware hash |
| 2.2.0 | Passed, including reboot | 2.2.1 password matches firmware hash |
| 2.2.1 | Passed, including reboot | 2.2.1 password matches firmware hash |
| 2.2.3 | Passed, including fan trial and reboot recovery | Newer password verified over SSH |
| 2.2.4 | Unsupported: stock SSH access unavailable | Password matches firmware hash; SSH enable hook removed |

Firmware 2.2.3 uses a read-only root filesystem and a separate fan controller.
The installer preserves read-only boot behavior and gives Paperclip sole control
of fan output. Rebooting during an unconfirmed tuning trial restored the previous
settings and mining resumed with accepted shares. Restoring the installation
backup also passed: the stock web page and startup configuration returned,
SSH remained recoverable, and the root filesystem booted read-only.

Firmware 2.2.4 removes the SSH-enable mechanism used by 2.2.3. It is rejected by
the installer. A stock-updater downgrade from 2.2.4 to the verified original KDBox
2.2.3 image succeeded on the test device, but downgrading is not automated by
Paperclip Flasher and carries the usual firmware flashing risks.

## Firmware 2.0.6 cooling

Installation defaults to 740 MHz, 430 mV and 100% fans. A staged clock test
followed by ten minutes at 740 MHz reached about 709 GH/s with accepted shares;
the highest observed chip temperature was 83°C. A separate installation and
reboot test passed at 500 MHz.

Shutdown remains set to 80°C average or 85°C chip temperature on this firmware.
These short tests do not guarantee thermal stability in a warmer environment.
Lower the clock if the device reaches its thermal limit; existing confirmed
settings are preserved when reinstalling.

## Scope of testing

An accepted share confirms that the tested miner submitted work accepted by its pool.
It does not guarantee long-term stability across every hardware revision or operating
environment. Use the installation backup and the conservative default tuning settings.

The installer does not upgrade or downgrade stock firmware. Do not flash a different
model's image or assume that a newer version preserves SSH or recovery access.
